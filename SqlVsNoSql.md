## SQL vs NoSQL

| Relational (RDBMS) | Non-Relational (or Not Only SQL or Distributed) |
| ------ | ------ |
| Table based | Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| Pre-defined schema | Dynamic schema |
| Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Scaling on powerful servers are expensive and difficult to handle. Handling tables across different servers is difficult   | Highly and easily scalable. Horizontal scaling means adding more machines into resources |
| MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL | MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb |
| Emphasizes ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) | Emphasizes CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance ) |
